4. Benchmark performance and quality

## Testing and Comparison

After setting up one or more of these environments, use the following methodology to test and compare A3D emulation quality:

### Test Content
1. **Static positioning**: Place sounds at fixed positions in 3D space
2. **Dynamic movement**: Move sounds in circular or complex patterns
3. **Environmental effects**: Test reverb, occlusion, and obstruction
4. **Complex scenes**: Test with multiple simultaneous sound sources

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Spatial accuracy**: How accurately can you locate sounds?
2. **Smoothness**: Are transitions between positions smooth?
3. **CPU/GPU usage**: How efficient is the processing?
4. **Compatibility**: Does it work with various content?
5. **Quality**: Overall audio quality and artifacts

### Documentation
Document your findings for each setup, noting:
1. Strengths and weaknesses
2. Compatibility issues
3. Performance metrics
4. Subjective quality assessment
5. Potential improvements

## Conclusion

By setting up these test environments, you can experiment with various approaches to A3D emulation and determine which best suits your needs. The modern DAW approach provides the most flexibility for new content creation, while the VM and emulation approaches allow testing with legacy software that specifically used A3D.

For the most authentic experience, a combination of approaches may be necessary, using modern spatial audio techniques for new content while preserving the ability to run legacy A3D applications through emulation or API wrappers.
