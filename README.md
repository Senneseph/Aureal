## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (latest stable version)
  - Install using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
  - Required for development of scraping and analysis tools

- **PowerShell** (Windows 10)
  - Used for scripting and automation

- **Git**
  - For version control

- **Binary Analysis Tools**
  - [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) for reverse engineering
  - [IDA Free](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/) (optional)

- **Audio Analysis Software**
  - [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for basic audio analysis
  - [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/) for advanced audio processing (optional)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```powershell
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd aureal-archaeology
   ```

2. **Set up Rust environment**
   ```powershell
   rustup update stable
   rustup component add clippy rustfmt
   ```

3. **Build the tools**
   ```powershell
   cd src/scrapers/vogons_scraper
   cargo build
   ```

4. **Set up documentation structure**
   ```powershell
   # The labs and documentation structure should already be in place
   # If not, run the following:
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path docs, data, tests -Force
   ```

## Project Phases

1. **Research Compilation** (1-2 months)
   - Information gathering
   - Documentation of existing knowledge

2. **Binary Analysis** (2-3 months)
   - Reverse engineering of drivers and software
   - Documentation of API and algorithms

3. **Emulation Testing** (1-2 months)
   - Testing in various emulation environments
   - Documentation of compatibility and issues

4. **CS/GoldSrc Analysis** (1 month)
   - Specific analysis of Counter-Strike implementation
   - Documentation of integration methods

5. **Modern Implementation** (3-4 months)
   - Development of modern A3D-inspired technology
   - Testing and optimization
